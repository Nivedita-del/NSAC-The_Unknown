# Abstract

We are trying to create a prediction model of gravitational waves and visualisation based on its characteristics to find wormholes, and also we are creating a live asteroid tracking with prediction model for impacting the earth.

# Goals
To increase the accuracy of prediction of gravitational waves and asteroid alert.
Try to achieve a live asteroid system where we can surface the names of asteroids that could collide with earth from the asteroid visualization model.
Identifying wormholes by finding similar gravitational energy signatures in different regions of space.

# Problem
We are aiming to solve two different problems:
1) Detecting and proving the existence of possible interstellar wormholes
2) Live tracking asteroids and predicting when they will hit earth

## Wormholes
Wormholes are solutions to the Einstein field equations for gravity that act as "tunnels," connecting points in space-time in such a way that the trip between the points through the wormhole could take much less time than the trip through normal space.
Wormholes are possible, according to Einstein's general theory of relativity, but nobody has ever spotted one. They are expected to require extreme gravitational conditions, such as those present at supermassive black holes like Sagittarius A* to form and are most likely to be found near one.
Asteroid tracking
Asteroids are small rocky bodies that orbit the sun. They are mostly found in the asteroid belt between mars and jupiter. Occasionally, asteroids' orbital paths are influenced by the gravitational tug of planets, which cause their paths to alter. It is believed that most extinction events in the history of our planet have been caused by asteroids colliding with earth. Hence, it is in our interest to detect, catalogue and track asteroids that may impact earth in the future.
