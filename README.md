# Abstract

We are trying to create a prediction model of gravitational waves and visualisation based on its characteristics to find wormholes, along with live asteroid tracking with a prediction model for impacting the earth. 

# How We Addressed This Challenge

We aimed to solve two different problems related to this challenge:

    Detecting and proving the existence of possible interstellar wormholes
    Live tracking asteroids and predicting when they will hit earth


#### We had the following goals:

    * To increase the accuracy of prediction of gravitational waves and asteroid alert.
    * Try to achieve a live asteroid system where we can surface the names of asteroids that could collide with earth from the asteroid visualization model.
    * Creating a GUI to live track the flagged asteroids
    * Identifying wormholes by finding similar gravitational energy signatures in different regions of space.
    * To make APIs available to users(amateur astronomers, scientists, etc) for them to access this data and visualize them. 
    
    
# How We Developed This Project
### Wormholes

Wormholes are solutions to the Einstein field equations for gravity that act as "tunnels," connecting points in space-time in such a way that the trip between the points through the wormhole could take much less time than the trip through normal space.

Wormholes are possible, according to Einstein's general theory of relativity, but nobody has ever spotted one. They are expected to require extreme gravitational conditions, such as those present at supermassive black holes like Sagittarius A* to form and are most likely to be found near one.


We find wormholes really interesting. If it was proved that wormholes exist, it would open up new interesting possibilities like space and time travel. We are excited to make that happen. This is our motivation and inspiration.

### Asteroid tracking

Asteroids are small rocky bodies that orbit the sun. They are mostly found in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter. Occasionally, asteroids' orbital paths are influenced by the gravitational tug of planets, which cause their paths to alter. It is believed that most extinction events in the history of our planet have been caused by asteroids colliding with earth. Hence, it is in our interest to detect, catalogue and track asteroids that may impact earth in the future.

### Wormhole Identification

Wormholes are expected to form near supermassive bodies. If a wormhole does exist at supermassive blackholes like Sagittarius A*, stars at the other end of the passage would be influenced by the gravity. The star should feel the gravitational influence of the wormhole thatâ€™s on the other side due to the gravitational flux going through the wormhole. We used gravitational wave data from NASA and LIGO to plot a q-transform of gravitational wave sources, which visually represents the frequency or energy of a gravitational source over time in a spectrogram. We then use this as the unique gravitational energy signature of the source. Each source has a unique gravitational energy signature, and if the gravitational energy signature of one source is detected at the other source, it probably means that there is a wormhole connecting them. This is what we are trying to identify.
